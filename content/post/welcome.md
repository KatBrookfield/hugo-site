## Hi, I'm Kat, welcome to my blog!

I am currently learning Kubernetes and needed a little test app to practice with.
I have decided to use Hugo to live-document my journey and will be publishing posts as I go along and change the configuration.  

**Few disclaimers before we start:**

1. Ideas in this blog are not solely mine, I am bulding on examples I have encountered during my studies, mainly from following sources (I will be updating this list):

    http://kube.academy

    Quick Start Kubernetes and The Kubernetes book by Nigel Poulton http://nigelpoulton.com

    Getting Started with Kubernetes by Eric Shanks https://theithollow.com/2019/01/26/getting-started-with-kubernetes/

2. I do not know what I'm doing (yet) so the approach I take may not always be the best.

3. Also, as this is a test site, it means that it may be down at times if I do something wrong :)

I will try to keep the posts simple and easy to follow so if you'd like to join me on this journey, follow advecti.io, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrsBrookfield), and reach out in case of questions.

### Current Environment setup:
    MacBook Air M1 - MacOS Big Sur 11.2.3 with Brew
    Docker Desktop 3.3.3 (64133)
    GitHub Desktop 2.8.3

Let's begin!
