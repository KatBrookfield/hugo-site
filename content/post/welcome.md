## Hi, I'm Kat, welcome to my blog!

I am currently learning Kubernetes and needed a little project to use as a test case.
I have decided to use Hugo to live-blog my journey and will be publishing posts as I go along and change the configuration.  

**Few disclaimers before we start:**

1. Ideas in this blog are not solely mine, I am bulding on examples I have encountered during my studies, mainly from following sources:

    http://kube.academy

    Quick Start Kubernetes and The Kubernetes book by Nigel Poulton http://nigelpoulton.com

    Getting Started with Kubernetes by Eric Shanks https://theithollow.com/2019/01/26/getting-started-with-kubernetes/

2. I do not know what I'm doing (yet) so the approach I take may not always be the best.

3. Also, as this is a test site, it means that it may be down at times if I do something wrong :)

I will try to keep the posts simple and easy to follow so if you'd like to join me on this journey, follow advecti.io and reach out in case of questions.

Let's beging!
